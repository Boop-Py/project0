# project0

In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, whatâ€™s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

This is my project. It consists of four webpages; a homepage, a page about food, a page about dogs and a page about Pokemon. Each page contains a navbar (using bootstrap) at the top to navigate between the pages. All of them also contain bootstrap styled headers.

The homepage (index.html) includes: 
An alert-style banner (using SCSS inheritance)
A list showing the criteria I needed to meet to complete project 0.
Two different tables with different stylings.

The dogues page (dogue.html) has a bootstrap styled warning at the top. I used the bootstrap grid with collumns to create a photo gallery - using all stock images. There are alt texts for each of the photos.

Pokemon (pokemon.html) is a page with a flexbox style and an alert. There are some images with captions on this page. 

The food page (food.html) has 3 collumns, each with a header, a picture and a list. 

The stylesheet I made myself (basic.css) is the main stylesheet (other than the bootstrap sheets). I used this to style pretty much all of the elements on all of the html pages. The other style sheet is called table.css, and this is compiled from tablesass.scss using a program called SASS. This is just an example of me using sass to nest and for inheritance style purposes.

I have included a folder with all of the images.
